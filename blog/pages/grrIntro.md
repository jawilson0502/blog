[GRR](https://github.com/google/grr) is an incident response framework created
by Google that allows one to perform remote live forensics on many machines. It
is cross platform and quite handy. I've been fortunate enough to work with this
framework as my intern project at Snapchat. In my adventures creating the
server environment, I've documented the easiest ways I've found to configure
GRR. I've decided to create a series of blog posts to share my experiences and
advice. I also would like to say thank you for everyone in the [GRR Users
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grr-users) for all the help!
Hope you all enjoy!
