## My adventure:
                    
In the information security field, or any information technology, computer 
science, information systems field, women are the minority. A
[study](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-state-of-women-in-technology-15-data-points-you-should-know/)   
from 2013 by techrepublic.com, shows that currently only 26% of the workforce 
is made up of women. We as women need to stand together to increase this number. 
In efforts towards that, 
[MTAM](http://www.gomobilemichigan.org/resources/advisory-councils/women-in-mobile-tech.html)
held its first Women in Mobile Technology conference that I was lucky enough to attend.

It was absolutely an amazing experience. They had a panel of speakers that 
consists of CISPO's, directors, and business owners, all of which had years 
and years of experience being a woman in this field. They shared some of 
their struggles, and some of their successes. They gave us ladies in the 
audience someone to emulate, and a goal to aspire to. Every woman on that 
panel showed us that our gender is not the deciding factor on what we can do. 
To say it was moving would be a great understatement.

MTAM also organized quite a bit of time for networking before the panel started 
speaking. It was such an experience to be able to speak with so many like-minded 
women who have similar goals to myself. I was able to meet a recent graduate 
from another college whose passion for mobile technology was so apparent. Her 
path was never an easy one, but she kept persevering. I met recruiters who were 
anxious to help bring more women in the field. I met lawyers and game designers, 
and teachers, all with the same goal: Inspire the current women in the field, 
and make sure our children know this is an opportunity they have as well.
					
While this may have been my first conference, it certainly will not be my last. 
To me there is never a better feeling than knowing you are not the only one 
struggling in a field dominated by men, and knowing you can thrive in it 
regardless of the adversity. I thank every person who stopped and made me feel welcome.
