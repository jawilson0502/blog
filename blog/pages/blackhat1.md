This will be the first of many posts in regards to my trip to Vegas, starting 
with what I learned from Black Hat 2015, through to the end of Defcon 23. I 
was so fortunate to attend both events, it was definitely the highlight of 
my summer.

## Keynote Address: Jennifer Granick's "Lifecycle of a Revolution"

The keynote was an amazing and inspiring talk about where our future will be 
if we don't step up and take it. Jennifer Granick was a great speaker who has 
worked in the infosec community as a lawyer representing influential people 
such as Michael Lynn and Aaron Swartz. She has seen our community through a 
different perspective and for hacker's rights with a tenacity that is amazing 
to behold.

One of her main concerns was how security is starting to take a back seat and 
we are moving toward a culture of have's and have not's. The rick and powerful 
will begin to dictate who gets what form of security, creating even bigger 
class disparities than we already have.

The Dream of Internet Freedom is dying before our eyes and we are speeding it 
along with our tacit complacency. We allow Congress to continue to pass laws 
that restrict our abiolity to tinker with the world around us. In this black 
box society we are moving towards, innovation dies.

## A prosperous tomorrow?

As a community, we need to stand up and force a change in policy. We should 
never be cowed into submission by those who wish to oppress us. By being able 
to listen to this enlightening talk, it made me truly reflect on what role I 
will play in this community's future. As I digest the information I've been 
given, I realize how many ways I can help. Without all of the community standing 
as one, we will fall.
