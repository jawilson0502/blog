## My Education
I am currently an Eastern Michigan University (EMU) undergraduate student majoring in Information Assurance and minoring in Computer Engineering Technologies. Some of the classes I've taken include Introduction to Information Security, Risk and Vulnerability Analysis, Introduction to Network and Business Technology, Digital Forensics I, Open Source Platform Administration, Intelligence Analysis I, Perl programming, Linux Security Administration, Computer Hardware and Software, Introduction to Computing in Engineering Technology, Programming in C++, Network Forensics, Embedded Computer Systems, Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering, and Windows Administration.

Some of my accomplishments at school include:
* Winning the 2016 Outstanding Student of the Year award
* Organizing and hosting YOLOcon 2016 and 2017 at EMU
* Receiving the 2016 Scholarship for Women Studying Information Security

## My Extracurriculars
In the Fall of 2015 I was elected the President of the Information Assurance Student Association, and served until Fall 2016. I was instrumental in the planning phases for club members to attend the 2015 and 2016 Michigan Collegiate Cyber Defense Network Qualifier for CCDC, and the 2015 and 2016 Information Security Talent Search hosted by Rochester Institute of Technology.

I've been very actively involved in bridging the gender gap in information security. I helped co-found the Women in Information Assurance group at EMU, providing a way to support the women in our program. I've also volunteered my time teaching middle and high school girls about STEM careers in EMU's Digital Divas program. I created two particular lesson plans, one to build a motion detector with a raspberry pi and python, and another on network forensics.

I also try to attend any workshops, conferences, and get-togethers I can that relate to my field. I've attended Blackhat and Defcon since 2015. I've received scholarships to attend the Women in Cyber Security Conference, the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, the O'reilly Security Conference, and HP Protect. I've spoken at the Ann Arbor Ypsilanti Assembly conference hosted by ArbSec in 2016 and 2017.

## My Job
I've interned at Snap Inc as a Security Engineer Intern twice, in summers 2016 and 2017, where I will be returning for full time in January 2017. I was a part of the corporate security team. My first intern project revolved around deploying [GRR Rapid Response](www.github.com/google/grr). I worked to implement, manage, and tailor it to the needs of our program. In 2017, I was responsible for upgrading the GRR infrastructure I had built previous, as well as assist in creating our disk acquistion process, and creating memory forensics playbooks.

I also spent my Fall 2015, Winter 2016, Fall 2016, and Winter 2017 working at [Virta Labs](www.virtalabs.com). My job duties included data collection and security research for medical devices. During that time, I was able to reproduce a known security issue within a medical device, as well as discover another. Due to that work, I was connected to a team at NIST and advised them for my approach to the device. While I was there I was also a part of the team that created their new product, BlueFlow. I helped create many of the integrations into BlueFlow, such as the Nexpose and Nessus integrations, as well as the sniffing integrations using scapy. I also worked as Security Operations, creating scripts to help secure the linux systems we were deploying.

## My Goals
My main goal is to become an outstanding member of the Information Security community. It may be lofty, but it is something I would like to work towards.
