Hello everyone and welcome to my first post!

## The why:
I've decided to start writing this blog so that anyone interested can follow 
along on my adventures. I also want to keep up a website so I can start 
understanding what makes a website tick and see how I can use that to further 
my studies. Another reason is I want an easy way for people to get to know me 
after some kind of networking event.

## The what:
So now the question becomes: what kind of posts can you expect?

My goal is to write blogs either based on an event I just attended, or to 
write about a new project I've started. I hope to share my experiences 
throughout the different phases of each. If you have any specific topics, 
you can feel free to email me and I will try to explore that topic to the 
best of my knowledge.
